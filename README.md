# ascii.java 🎨

## 📌 Overview  
`ascii.java` is a **Java-based ASCII Art Project**, developed as part of my **BCA 2nd Year (3rd Semester) coursework** at *Dezyne École College*.  
The project demonstrates the use of **loops and conditional statements** in Java to generate ASCII-based patterns including **letters, words, alphabet ranges, numbers, and symbols**.  

It also includes a **menu-driven interface** where users can choose different options and continue after viewing each pattern.

## 🚀 Features  
- Print **letters, words, and alphabet ranges** in ASCII style.  
- Print **numbers and symbols** like `@`, `#`, `!`, `$`, `?`.  
- **Menu-driven interface** for easy navigation.  
- Option to **continue after each pattern**, making it interactive.  
- Simple **command-line execution** (no external libraries).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Language:** Java 17  
- **IDE:** VS Code  
- **Libraries:** None (pure Java)

## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Open terminal and navigate to the project directory.  
2. Compile the program:
      ```sh
   javac ascii.java
3. Run the program:
      ```sh
      java ascii
## 📖 Learning Outcomes  

Through this project, I practiced and understood:  

- **Java loops** (`Nested for loops`, `do-while loop`)  
- **Conditional statements** (`if-else`)  
- **Menu-driven program design** in Java  
- Handling **user input/output** in console applications
